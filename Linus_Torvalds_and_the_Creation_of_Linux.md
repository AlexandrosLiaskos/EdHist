# Linus Torvalds and the Creation of Linux

In 1991, a Finnish computer science student named Linus Torvalds embarked on a personal project that would eventually become one of the most influential pieces of software in the world: the Linux kernel.

### **Humble Beginnings**

Torvalds started his project as a hobby, aiming to create a free operating system kernel that anyone could use and modify. His inspiration came from MINIX, a small Unix-like operating system, but he wanted to create something that was both powerful and accessible.

### **The Announcement**

In August 1991, Torvalds made a now-famous post on the comp.os.minix newsgroup:

`Hello everybody out there using minix - I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).`

This modest announcement did not hint at the revolution that was about to begin.

### The Power of Open Source

Torvalds released the first version of the Linux kernel under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which meant anyone could freely use, modify, and distribute it. This open-source model encouraged collaboration and innovation, attracting developers worldwide to contribute to Linux.

### Linux Today

From those modest beginnings, Linux has grown exponentially. It's now the backbone of many systems worldwide, from web servers and supercomputers to smartphones (via Android), and embedded devices. Its development is one of the most prominent examples of global collaboration, with thousands of developers contributing to its code.

### Impact and Legacy

The creation of Linux by Linus Torvalds and its subsequent evolution is a testament to the power of open-source software. It demonstrates how a project, started by an individual with a vision, can grow into something that powers much of the modern world's technology. Linux's success has also spurred the growth of open-source culture, influencing countless other projects.
