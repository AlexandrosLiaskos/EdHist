# Tim Berners-Lee and the Creation of the World Wide Web

In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist working at CERN, proposed a new way of accessing and sharing information over the internet. His vision led to the creation of the World Wide Web, an invention that transformed society and the way we communicate, learn, and share information.

### The Genesis of the Web

Berners-Lee observed the challenges faced by researchers in sharing and accessing information across different computer systems. He envisioned a global information space where data could be linked and accessed through a network of documents – this vision was the foundation of the Web.

### Inventing the Web

Berners-Lee developed the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s Web:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
- **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: a unique address used to identify each resource on the Web.
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: the protocol used for transmitting Web pages.

With these technologies, he also created the first Web browser and Web server, demonstrating the Web’s practicality.

### The Web Goes Public

In 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free for anyone to use and develop, a pivotal decision that fueled the Web's rapid expansion. Berners-Lee's commitment to an open and accessible Web laid the groundwork for the explosion of Web applications and services that followed.

### The Legacy of the Web

The World Wide Web has fundamentally changed how we live, enabling new forms of social interaction, e-commerce, information dissemination, and online collaboration. It has become an integral part of modern life, influencing culture, business, and technology.

### Ongoing Advocacy

Tim Berners-Lee continues to advocate for the Web as a free and open resource. He founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to lead the Web to its full potential and has been a vocal advocate for net neutrality, privacy, and the Web as a right.
